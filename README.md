# Foil Finder

Foil Finder is a Next.js + Tailwind CSS project designed to help riders discover the best hydrofoil setups based on skill level, weight, riding style, and conditions. The goal is to make foiling more accessible by giving users clear explanations, easy filters, and links to real products from top brands.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React**
